                I have worked in the programming industry for just under ten years and have worked 
                on a variety of big and small projects. Solving problems and increasing efficiency of 
                logic is probably my favorite aspect of the job.

                Besides programming, my hobbies include gaming, hiking, climbing, traveling and just 
                trying to get out and have a unique experience.
